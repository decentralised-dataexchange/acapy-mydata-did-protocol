## ACA-Py Version Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with ACA-Py version 0.5.6.

## Installation

Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Setup Aries Cloud Agent - Python

If you already have an existing installation of ACA-Py, you can skip these steps
and move on to [plugin installation](#plugin-installation). It is also worth
noting that this is not the only way to setup an ACA-Py instance. For more setup
configurations, see the [Aries Cloud Agent - Python
repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python).

First, prepare a virtual environment:
```sh
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Install ACA-Py 0.5.6 into the virtual environment:
```sh
$ pip install aries-cloudagent==0.5.6
```

### Plugin Installation

Install this plugin into the virtual environment:

```sh
$ pip install acapy-mydata-did-protocol
```

**Note:** Depending on your version of `pip`, you may need to drop or add 
`#egg=mydata_did` to install the plugin with the above command.
